The dApp Donation landing page will have a main page that equally has a navigation menu leading to the Transactions and Scholar's Progress pages which will just contain the titles.

On the homepage which is also the Scholarship Pool page will have two donate cards, when the button on the cards are clicked it should lead to a Donation page.

On the Donation page, an option has to be selected before the button will be removed from its disabled state and it'll lead to a Confirmation page.

On the Confirmation page when the button is clicked, it should change from Confirm to Processing, then when the Processing button is clicked, it should go to a thank you page.
